## Introduction

The "WINGFLEXSIM Device Integration Development Documentation" helps you integrate WINGFLEXSIM devices into your software. To facilitate developers using their preferred programming languages, we currently provide example code in JavaScript. You can easily write test code in HTML and verify the integration effects in a browser.

After understanding the integration methods, you can use almost any language or framework to integrate WINGFLEXSIM devices into any connection software.

Currently, we provide integration documentation for the following devices:

- A320 FCU CUBE

Documentation for other devices is still being edited and tested.
