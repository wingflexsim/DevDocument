To support a broader ecosystem of devices, we are releasing the **WINGFLEXSIM Device Integration Development Documentation**. This document is intended to help community developers, hardware vendors, and enthusiasts integrate device functionality in their preferred way, enabling compatibility with more gaming platforms and simulator models.

## Overview

The **WINGFLEXSIM Device Integration Development Documentation** helps you integrate WINGFLEXSIM devices into your own software. To accommodate developers using different programming languages, we currently provide **JavaScript sample code**. You can easily write and test integration code in HTML and verify it directly in your browser.

Once you understand the integration method, you can extend support to virtually any programming language or framework, and integrate it into any connection software or platform.

Currently supported devices:

- A320 FCU CUBE

Integration documentation for other devices is under development and testing.
